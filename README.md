### Basic Movie Recommendation System

The larger framework of this project is made by following similar pre-made projects on Youtube, however, I did also make lots of changes myself, such as adding a class, cleaning and organizing redundant/inefficient code, and also a graphic interface using Tkinter. I thought about also implementing a crawler that goes through real movie databases rather than a downloaded one such as IMBD, but it is rather difficult as at this moment I don't know how to bypass their anit-crawling measures yet. Maybe I'll come back and pick this project up. Other than that, this was lots of fun, and I really enjoyed tuning the program myself rather than just 100% copying a tutorial.
